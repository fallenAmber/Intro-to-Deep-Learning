# Intro-to-Deep-Learning

This work is modeled on Kaggle’s ‘’Intro to Deep Learning Course.” Here, I will build a beginner friendly deep neural network using Keras and Tensorflow. We will:

•	create a fully-connected neural network architecture

•	apply neural nets to two classic ML problems: regression and classification

•	train neural nets with stochastic gradient descent, and

•	improve performance with dropout, batch normalization, and other techniques
